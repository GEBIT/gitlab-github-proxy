# GitLab-GitHub Proxy
Proxy to provide GitHub-like API on top of Gitlab. Especially designed to use the **JIRA DVCS connector** with Gitlab.

WORK IN PROGRESS: Completely unfinished and untested at the moment.

## Use it
### 1. Execute the proxy
It needs to be reachable from the JIRA installation as well as the end-user browsers using the same DNS name and on port 80.
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dcom.dkaedv.glghproxy.gitlab_url=http://yourgitlabserver.yourcompany.com
```

### 2. Configure authorization in GitLab
In the Admin Area, at Applications, create a new application. The callback url should be set to the address where you run the proxy like the following
```
http://glproxy/login/oauth/authorize_callback
```

### 3. Add DVCS account in JIRA
Create a GitHub Enterprise account with the following data:
* Team or User Account = Gitlab namespace you want to synchronize
* Host URL = URL of the proxy, e.g. http://glproxy
* OAuth Key = Application Id (generated by Gitlab)
* OAuth Secret = Secret (generated by Gitlab)
